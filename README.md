Simple memory game, implemented to be used on a swiftbot. <br/>

Originally, this was supposed to be a collaborative design task in my first year of university but I decided to make an implementation for fun.
Uses the BACK_LR and MIDDLE_LR LEDs under the frame to display color patterns, input is taken via the A/B/X/Y back buttons. Each button corresponds to an LED in a natural way, and allows you to hold the swiftbot like a controller. 
<br/><br/>
Implemented a highscore system for you to best your previous attempts. 
To use, simply just run this on a SwiftBot (you probably don't have one)
